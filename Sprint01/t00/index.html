        Peter Benjamin Parker was born in Queens to CIA agents Richard and Mary Parker, who were killed by the Red Skull and framed for 
        treason during a mission. Before their deaths, however, Richard and Mary had another child unknown to Peter, a daughter and Peter's 
        younger sister, Teresa. Following his parents' death, a young Parker was adopted by his uncle and aunt, Ben and May Parker, moving 
        in with them at their residence in Forest Hills, New York. After their adopting of him, they became his surrogate parents and 
        raised him as if he were their own son. Over the years into being a teenager, Parker grew to be a prodigy in multiple scholastic 
        subjects at Midtown High School and achieving high honors among his classmates. However, his reserved nature and enthusiasm for 
        knowledge often made him a target for bullying, primarily football star Eugene "Flash" Thompson.

        While attending a General Techtronics public exhibition, a 15-year-old Peter Parker was bitten on the hand by a spider, which was 
        irradiated by the demonstration's particle accelerator. Oblivious after falling from his hand, the spider used its last pulses of 
        life to bite a girl, Cindy Moon, on the ankle before dying from the radiation.Making his way home afterward, Peter was almost hit 
        by a car until he leapt out of the way onto a building site a couple of meters high. Peter discovered he had somehow gained 
        incredible strength, agility, and surface scaling; all spider-like traits that he immediately associated with the spider bite 
        at the demonstration.Encountering an ad offering a cash prize for lasting three minutes in the ring with Joseph "Crusher" Hogan, 
        Peter decided this would be a good way to test his powers. Wearing a mask to avoid humiliation in case of defeat, Peter used his 
        powers and easily defeated his opponent.TV producer Maxwell Shiffman observed his performance and convinced him to go on television 
        with his 'act.' Designing a full costume and fabricating synthetic spider's web and wrist-mounted web-shooters, Peter debuted as 
        Spider-Man to become an immediate sensation.Following his first TV appearance, stardom fueled Peter in his Spider-Man suit failed 
        to act to stop an escaping thief, claiming that it wasn't his responsibility. Peter forgot the incident as his fame rose, but 
        days later he returned home late to find his Uncle Ben murdered. Learning the police had the burglar responsible holed up in a 
        warehouse, Peter changed into Spider-Man and easily captured him, only to discover he was the same thief he had allowed to 
        escape earlier.Filled with remorse knowing that his inaction leads to tragedy, he realized that when someone has the power 
        they have an obligation to use it responsibly. From this realization of the gravity of events, he decided to become a vigilante 
        superhero helping whoever he could.

        Spider-Man is commonly seen as a brave and righteous hero with an indomitable sense of justice and responsibility. Shaken by his 
        uncle's tragic death, Spider-Man's vow of responsibility has led him to a path of heroism and humanitarian service. There are 
        times when Spider-Man's sense of responsibility can be almost overbearing; this was evidently noted by Luke Cage when he felt 
        embarrassed about Electro causing the Raft breakout, despite the fact he had nothing to do with it. This combined with his 
        strong moral compass in the face of adversity and sharp wit makes him one of the most iconic and enduring heroes in the Marvel 
        Universe. One of Spider-Man's most prominent traits is his sense of humor. He at times is seen as the class clown in every group 
        he is in. Even in the face of certain death, Spider-Man invariably cracks a joke, to the annoyance of both friends and foes. His 
        reasons for this vary: either he wants to relieve the stress of a situation, or simply because he wants to hide how scared he 
        really is during a crisis. Also, he does this to get on the nerves of his opponents, since he knows that if they are angry, that 
        they would normally lose themselves and be vulnerable to a superior skilled opponent. It is generally agreed, however, that 
        whenever a life is in danger, he will stop telling jokes and take the current situation with the utmost seriousness.</p>

        Behind this humorous facade, however, is a wounded soul that has gone through much suffering. While Spider-Man is in combat, 
        occasionally another person dies, leaving him depressed for having failed in his responsibility. Guilt over the loss of his 
        Uncle Ben continues to be the primary motivating factor in his super-heroics and his life in general. Peter is quick to assume 
        guilt and responsibility for anything bad that happens in his presence or that can, in some way, relate back to him. For 
        instance, he assumed responsibility for Electro's mass breakout at the Raft and Norman Osborn's Initiative because they were 
        "his" villains. Death, in particular, is difficult for Peter to reconcile with, leading him to make dramatic and unrealistic 
        proclamations, such as his "Nobody dies!" credo after Marla Madison's passing. Peter has developed post-traumatic stress 
        disorder, particularly related to Norman Osborn's murder of Gwen Stacy and Flash Thompson, which was exacerbated by Kindred 
        repeatedly killing and resurrecting him. Peter also deeply hates symbiotes and blames himself for everyone who has died 
        at the hands of Venom, Carnage, and other symbiotes due to having brought the Venom symbiote to Earth. Spider-Man is also 
        traditionally a loner. Due to his individualistic style, having been a social outcast in his youth, Spider-Man finds it hard to 
        work in teams. However, this has gradually lessened over the years, to the point Spider-Man has worked actively with the Avengers. 
        Peter is also a strong-willed hero, whatever obstacles that come his way, if it's relationships, being misunderstood, or someone 
        dying in his watch, he always gets back up. His indomitable will and don't give up attitude usually pushed him to do amazing feats 
        like supporting the weight of a jet and beating up Firelord. Despite being a hero, Spider-Man is nerdy, awkward, and shy. 
        These traits have faded through the years as Parker grew up and gained confidence, but elements of the awkward teenage nerd still 
        remain in his personality.
